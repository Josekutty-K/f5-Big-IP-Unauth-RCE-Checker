# f5-Big-IP-Unauth-RCE-Checker
To test my skills, I was creating Python scripts to test F5 Big IP unauthenticated remote code vulnerability CVE 2020–5902, CVE 2022–1388

Copy and paste the test.py, give necessary permissions, and run python3 test.py, then enter the target domain or ip with port number, the script will try to get the contents of /etc/passwd.
